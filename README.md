# Web Application Security

This repository contains hands on labs and write ups focused on **web application security**.

Most of the work here comes from platforms like **PortSwigger Web Security Academy**, but the goal goes beyond solving labs.

I use these exercises to train how I **analyze application behavior**, break assumptions, and understand how logic flaws appear in real systems.

## What this repository includes

Inside this repository you’ll find:

- Write ups of web security labs
- Authentication and access control flaws
- Business logic vulnerabilities
- Input validation and trust issues
- Realistic attack reasoning, not just payloads

The focus is on *why* something is vulnerable, not only *how* it is exploited.

## How I approach web security

I treat web applications as systems with logic, not as a list of vulnerabilities.

My approach is usually:
- observe requests and responses
- compare normal vs abnormal behavior
- question what the application trusts
- look for inconsistencies in flow and validation

Many of the issues I work on are not about complex exploits, but about **broken assumptions**.

## Why web application security matters to me

Most real world attacks still start at the web layer.

Even strong technologies fail when:
- logic is flawed
- client input is trusted
- security controls are applied inconsistently

Understanding web security helps me think both offensively and defensively, and connects naturally with SOC and cloud security.

## Notes

- This repository reflects practical learning and experimentation
- Write ups are intentionally clear and human-readable
- The goal is understanding and communication, not just exploitation
